## Load Libraries

```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rstatix)  # pairwise_t_test()
library(psych)    # describeBy()
library(ez)       # ezANOVA()
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

::: {.fyi}
If you have trouble installing the tidyverse package, you can install/load the individual packages that we need.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)   # mutate()
library(tidyr)   # pivot_longer()
library(ggplot2) # plotting
library(readr)   # importing csv
```
:::

## Create/Import Data

The next step is to either load some data into R or create some data ourselves. For the exercises within this lab, we will load some data from the file "stepspday.csv"^[Gravetter, F. J. & Wallnau, L. B. (2016). Statistics for the behavioural sciences. (10th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.] (which should be inside the "data" folder within your R project).

```{r import_data}
# import data and force the read_csv() function to make
# the variables into certain types
data_ANOVA_rm <- read_csv(file = here("data",
                            "stepspday.csv"))
```

## Clean Up the Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

For data imported using the {readr} package, you can check whether there were any parsing problems using the `problems()` function.

```{r check_for_problems}
# check for parsing problems
# e.g., were there problems forcing a variable to be a certain type
problems(data_ANOVA_rm)
```

It is always a good idea to `View()` your data **every** time you import it to ensure that the data look the way expect. This is especially important if you have never seen the data before.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# take a peak at the data
View(data_ANOVA_rm)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# HTML friendly data display
rmarkdown::paged_table(data_ANOVA_rm)
```

Once we look at our data, we should notice that it is in *wide* format, but many functions in R need data to be in *long* format (most notably ggplot2 functions and many functions for repeated measures ANOVA).

The following animation show the process we need to do to convert data from *wide* format to *long* format using the `pivot_longer()` function from the *tidyr* package.

::: {.fyi}
Here is a helpful animation by Alison Hill [^1] showing how the `pivot_longer()` function works. ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apreshill/teachthat/master/pivot/pivot_longer_smaller.gif)
:::

[^1]: pivot_longer() animation retrieved from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apreshill/teachthat/master/pivot/pivot_longer_smaller.gif>

To use `pivot_longer()`, we need at least four arguments:

-   *data*

    -   a data.frame or tibble

-   *cols*

    -   the columns which you want to gather together

-   *names_to*

    -   the name of a new vector which holds the names of the columns from which a value came from

-   *values_to*

    -   the name of a new vector which holds the values from the columns we are converting into a long column

Let's try it out!

```{r}
# convert data into long format for the Weeks
data_ANOVA_rm_long <- data_ANOVA_rm %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Week1, Week6, Week12),
               names_to = "Week",
               values_to = "ave_steps_per_day")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# take a peak at the data
View(data_ANOVA_rm_long)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# HTML friendly data display
rmarkdown::paged_table(data_ANOVA_rm_long)
```

### Puzzle

::: {.puzzle}
Instead of manually writing out the names of the variables you want to `pivot_longer()`, try using the tidy helper function `starts_with()` to select the variables. You can also remove the prefixes from the variables using the "names_prefix" argument in the `pivot_longer()` function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data_ANOVA_rm %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = <YOUR CODE HERE>,
               names_to = "Week",
               values_to = "ave_steps_per_day",
               names_prefix = "Week")
```
:::

### Show Solution

::: {.puzzle}
```{r}
# convert the data to long format
data_ANOVA_rm %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Week"),
               names_to = "Week",
               values_to = "ave_steps_per_day",
               names_prefix = "Week")
```
:::

```{r create_factor}
data_ANOVA_rm_long <- data_ANOVA_rm_long %>%
  mutate(ID = parse_factor(ID),
         Week = parse_factor(Week))
```

## Check Assumptions

### Normality in **Each** Group

#### QQ-Plots

A quantile-quantile (qq-plot) is one way to visually assess whether a variable is approximately normally distributed. If each variable were normally distributed, then the points would fall exactly on the line.

To construct a qq-plot using the {ggplot2} package, begin by passing our data.frame/tibble to the `ggplot()` function and map the variable *quality* to the *sample* aesthetic. Next add a layer of points (using `geom_qq()`) and the quantile line (using `geom_qq_line()`). The final step for assessing the distribution of recall scores across both groups is to create a panel for each group using the `facet_grid()` function.

```{r}
# assess normality using a qqplot
# - for qqplot you need to use an aesthetic called "sample"
ggplot(data = data_ANOVA_rm_long,
       mapping = aes(sample = ave_steps_per_day)) +
    geom_qq() +
    geom_qq_line() +
    facet_grid(~Week)
```

#### Box Plots

A box plot is another way to visually assess the distribution of a variable. A few things to look for when assessing a distribution for normality:

-   The median is centred within the box (the inter-quartile)
-   There are no outliers
-   Both whiskers extend an appropriate amount beyond the upper and lower edges of the box.

```{r}
# create a box plot to show "recall" distribution for each group
ggplot(data_ANOVA_rm_long,
       aes(x = Week,
           y = ave_steps_per_day)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

#### Using Descriptive Statistics

In past exercises, we have used the `describe()` function to compute descriptive statistics. Today, we will use a related function from the {psych} package called `describeBy()` (note the capital "B"). This will break your data set into groups, and compute descriptive statistics separately for each group.

This function needs three vectors; one vector which you want descriptive statistics for, and two others vector which tell the function how to subset your data first. You need to wrap the two grouping variables inside the `list()` function.

```{r}
# assess normality using descriptive statistics
describeBy(x = data_ANOVA_rm_long$ave_steps_per_day,
           group = data_ANOVA_rm_long$Week)
```

### Sphericity

Mauchly's test can be used to assess for violations of sphericity. The {EZ} package conducts Mauchly's test along with the ANOVA. See output below (in conduct test section).

## Effect Size

For a two-way ANOVA, one recommended effect size which should be reported and interpreted is generalized eta-squared, $\eta_G^2$. When you conduct the two-way ANOVA using the `ezANOVA()` function, $\eta_G^2$ is computed for you (though the function labels the output as *ges*).

## Conduct Test

We will use the {EZ} package to conduct our ANOVA test (and Levene's test). Specifically, we will use the `ezANOVA()` function because it can be used to conduct a variety of ANOVA tests, so once we learn this function it will help us later on as well. To conduct a two-way ANOVA you need to specify four arguments:

-   *data* - the data.frame/tibble where you data "lives"

-   *wid* - a variable with a unique subject id for each subject

    -   if the variable you supply to the *wid* argument is not a factor, the function will temporarily convert it for you

-   *within* - a variable containing within subject grouping information

-   *dv* - the outcome variable

```{r}
# conduct an independent samples ANOVA
# then save the results into an object
ANOVA_results <- ezANOVA(data = data_ANOVA_rm_long,
        wid = ID,
        within = Week,
        dv = ave_steps_per_day)
```

::: {.fyi}
If you are unsure what some of the values in the `ezANOVA()` output are referring to, then check the help documentation in the *Value* section. You can open the help documentation using the following code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
?ez::ezANOVA
```
:::

```{r}
# Check the results from Levene's test
ANOVA_results$`Mauchly's Test for Sphericity`
```

::: {.note}
Be sure to ALWAYS always check the results of Mauchly's test for sphericity PRIOR to checking the ANOVA results because if there was a problem with sphericity of variances then you can't trust the *p*-value from the ANOVA.

If there is a problem with sphericity, then you will need to use a correction.

-   Note the little clickable arrow pointing to the right. This button lets you view more columns from these results.

``` {reval="FALSE"}
ANOVA_results$`Sphericity Corrections`
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
ANOVA_results$`Sphericity Corrections` %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```
:::

```{r eval=FALSE}
ANOVA_results$ANOVA
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Check the results from the ANOVA test
ANOVA_results$ANOVA %>%
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

## Post-Hoc Tests

In order to conduct all pairwise *paired* t-tests, we will be using the `pairwise_t_test()` function from the {rstatix} package (don't forget to install it first!).

To use this function, we need to specify a few arguments:

-   *data*

    -   a data.frame or tibble

-   *formula*

    -   a formula which has the DV followed by \~ and the IV (grouping variable)

-   *paired*

    -   this needs to be set to `TRUE` so that function knows that we have paired data

-   *p.adjust.method*

    -   correction for multiple tests

-   *detailed*

    -   this returns extra information from the t-tests about confidence intervals, etc.

The nice thing about this function is that the results are returned as a data.frame/tibble. So we can use other functions that work with this type of result to remove unneeded columns. In this example, we are going to remove the column of uncorrected p-values so that we don't accidentally use them in our results discussion.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# conduct all pairwise, paired, t-tests
pairwise_t_test(data = data_ANOVA_rm_long,
                formula = ave_steps_per_day ~ Week,
                paired = TRUE,
                p.adjust.method = "bonferroni",
                detailed = TRUE) %>% 
  select(-p)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
pairwise_t_test(data = data_ANOVA_rm_long,
                formula = ave_steps_per_day ~ Week,
                paired = TRUE,
                p.adjust.method = "bonferroni",
                detailed = TRUE) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-p) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

# Friedman Rank Sum Test

In the event that the assumptions of normality and sphericity were not met, we can conduct the Friedman Rank Sum test.

The formula gets a bit tricky. The only thing we need to change from this ANOVA type formula is to add `|ID` to the end. This tells the function to pair the tests using the variable *ID*.

```{r}
friedman.test(formula = ave_steps_per_day~Week|ID,
              data = data_ANOVA_rm_long)
```
