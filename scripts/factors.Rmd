# Factors

Factors are R's way of storing categorical/discrete data. This exercise was designed to make working with factors a bit easier and error-free.

Just like every R script we write, let's begin with a comment describing what we are hoping to achieve with this script and the libraries which need to be installed/loaded.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Exercises: practice creating and manipulating factors
library(tidyverse)
```

:::fyi
If you have trouble installing the tidyverse package, you can install/load the individual packages that we need.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readr)   # parse_factor() function
library(dplyr)   # for easier subsetting and
# data manipulation
library(forcats) # create/mutate factors easier
library(ggplot2) # graphics
```
:::

For the first example, let's imagine that I asked 6 students in the class what their birth month was, and I saved their responses into a vector like this:

```{r}
# sample of birth months
month_dat <- c("Jan", "Aug", "Dec", "Mar", "Jun","Jun")
```

I also could have saved the same information by recording each student's response as a numerical value (i.e., Jan is 1, Feb is 2, etc.).

```{r}
# sample of birth months (represented as integers)
month_dat_int <- c(1, 8, 12, 3, 6, 6)
```

Both of these vectors contain the same information, but one of them is a bit easier to read and understand what the values mean. Typically, when working with vectors which are meant to convey categorical information, we want to convert them to a factor so that they are treated appropriately when we create plots or run an analysis.

If you are not sure if using a factor is appropriate, keep in mind that factors should be used when there is a **fixed and known** set of categories (or possible values) which can occur. Using our example of birth month, there are only 12 possible months of the year in which a student could have been born.

# Creating Factors

There are a few ways we can convert a vector into a factor. The first we will look at is the `factor()` function.

```{r}
# convert sample into a factor
factor(month_dat)
```
In the output, we see the values from our sample followed by a list of the observed levels. As far as R is concerned, the only valid levels it needs to worry about are the distinct birth months it saw in our vector. Also, notice that when we use the `factor()` function **without** using the argument *levels*, R orders the levels of the factor alphabetically (the above output). If we want to override this ordering (perhaps with a more sensible ordering), we can tell the `factor()` function the *levels* we expect to see (and their ordering).

```{r}
# specify the months in their proper order manually
month_levels <- c("Jan","Feb","Mar",
                  "Apr","May","Jun",
                  "Jul","Aug","Sep",
                  "Oct","Nov","Dec")

# Convert our sample to a factor
month_dat <- factor(x = month_dat,
                    levels = month_levels)

# display the results to the console so that we can check that it is working the way we expect it to
month_dat
```
From the output above, we can see that the ordering of the levels (i.e., the birth months) is retained, and even though no students in our sample were born in most of the months, those months were still included as valid values/levels.

# Problems with `factor()`

But what if we made a typing error?  
What if I accidentally typed "Jum" instead of "Jun"?  
What do you think R will do?

```{r}
# generate new vector with a typing error
month_dat_typo <- c("Jan","Aug","Jum")

# convert to factor
factor(x = month_dat_typo,
       levels = month_levels)
```

That misspelled month was not one of the valid levels, so R replaced the problematic value with `NA`. An important point to note here is that R did not trigger an error or warning to let you know that a value is now missing. It assumes you knew about it or that you would check for it yourself.

To avoid accidentally losing your data, I recommend using the `parse_factor()` function from the {readr} package (which is loaded when you load the {tidyverse} package).

The end result between using `factor()` and `parse_factor()` is the mostly the same (the problematic value still goes missing) except that the later function prints a warning message letting you know that the function converted a value to `NA`. See the following output for an example.

```{r highlight.output=c(1)}
# To get warnings when R does these conversions use the parse_factor() function from the readr package
month_dat_parsed <- parse_factor(x = month_dat_typo,
                                 levels = month_levels)
```

:::note
This warning is actually like a small data.frame/tibble with four columns: **row**, **col**, **expected**, and **actual.** The *row* and *col* columns tell you the locations of any problems that occurred when converting a vector into a factor. In this case, there was only one problem which can be found in the first and only column (indicated by "--") and the third row. We can also tell that the `parse_factor()` function was expecting that all values in our *month_dat_typo* object could be found somewhere in the set of levels we told R about (i.e., the *month_levels* object). The values in the actual column show you the problematic value which might need to be changed.
:::

If we type the name of the object into the console pane, R prints out the sample/observed values, the tibble of problems, followed by the valid levels of the factor.

```{r}
month_dat_parsed
```

:::fyi
Once you have converted a vector into a factor, you can check the levels of the factor using the `levels()` function.
```{r}
levels(month_dat_parsed)
```
:::

# Combining Multiple Factors {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Let's assume we conducted a survey across three studies and asked each subject to write down which gender they identify with. Here are some fictitious data I will use for this example.

```{r}
# study 1 only had 2 subjects who identified as male and female
study_1 <- parse_factor(c("male", "female"))

# study 2 only had 2 subjects who identified as female and non-binary
study_2 <- parse_factor(c("female", "non-binary"))

# study 3 only had 1 subject who identified as male
study_3 <- parse_factor(c("male"))
```

You may have encountered the `c()` function (which is used to **c**ombine or **c**oncatenate vectors together) before, but I think that you will be surprised by the result.

```{r}
# naive approach, use the combine function
c(study_1, study_2, study_3)
```

So, how did values like "male", "female", and "non-binary" become a bunch of ones and twos?

The short answer is that R stores factors as integers, and each integer has a label/level attached to it. Sometimes this give unexpected results when working with factors. The `str()` (pronounced as "structure") function can take a peak inside of an R object to see how the data inside is ordered.

```{r}
# print the structure of study_1 to the console.
str(study_1)
```
The output tells us that the object (*study_1*) is a factor with two levels: "male" and "female". These two levels are respectively stored as the numbers 1 and 2. When we combine factors using `c()`, R uses these integers and that is why we get weird results. To make a long story short, take care when handling factors.

:::fyi
The forcats package has many helpful functions for working with factors, most of them share a common prefix "fct_" to make them easier to find.
:::

## Puzzle

:::puzzle
Go to the online help documentation for the {forcats} package at [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forcats/versions/0.3.0](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forcats/versions/0.3.0) and locate the section "Functions in forcats". Find the function that will properly **c**ombine or **c**oncatenate factors together.

If done correctly, the new factor which combines *study_1*, *study_2*, and *study_3* together should like similar to this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
fct_c(study_1,study_2,study_3)
```
:::

## Show Solution

:::puzzle
The `fct_c()` function from the forcats can combine multiple factors together properly.
```{r}
fct_c(study_1,study_2,study_3)
```

# Collapsing Levels of a Factor {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Sometimes we may too many levels to a factor, or some levels of a factor might be better understand by being put together into a new level.

For instance, using our birth month example from earlier, perhaps we might want to figure out which season of the year students were born in.

The {forcats} package has a handy function for doing exactly this task, `fct_collapse()`. The first argument is the factor we want to use when collapsing down levels, and we can then supply the name of the new level followed by a character vector of the old levels which need to be combined together.

```{r}
# Collapse three months onto a new level, "spring"
month_dat_seasons <- fct_collapse(.f = month_dat,
                                  spring = c("Mar","Apr","May"))

# Print the result to the console
month_dat_seasons
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
month_dat_seasons <- fct_collapse(
  .f = month_dat,
  spring = c("Mar","Apr","May"),
  summer = c("Jun","Jul","Aug"),
  fall = c("Sep","Oct","Nov"),
  winter = c("Dec","Jan","Feb"))
```

## Puzzle

:::puzzle
Finish the collapsing the rest of the seasons into new levels
```{r eval=FALSE}
month_dat_seasons <- 
  fct_collapse(.f = month_dat,
               spring = c("Mar","Apr","May"),
               <YOUR CODE HERE>,
               <YOUR CODE HERE>,
               <YOUR CODE HERE>)
```
:::

## Show Solution

:::puzzle
```{r}
month_dat_seasons <-
  fct_collapse(month_dat,
             spring = c("Mar","Apr","May"),
             summer = c("Jun","Jul","Aug"),
             fall = c("Sep","Oct","Nov"),
             winter = c("Dec","Jan","Feb"))
```

# Other Helpful Functions

## `fct_count()`

A helpful function I use from time-to-time is `fct_count()`. This function returns a data.frame/tibble with two columns. The first, *f*, contains all of the levels or unique values within a given factor. The second, *n*, contains the count of how many rows in the full dataset have a value the same as the level from *f*.

We can use it to check that we collapsed levels from an old factor properly and that none went mysteriously went missing.

```{r}
# get counts of each birth month
fct_count(month_dat)

# get counts of each birth season
fct_count(month_dat_seasons)
```

## `fct_drop()`

This function drops all unused levels from a factor. To try it out, let's use our factor from earlier int he exercise "month_dat".

```{r}
# Check the valid levels in the original factor
levels(month_dat)

# Start with the original factor, and then ...
# drop unused levels, and then ...
# check the valid remaining levels
month_dat %>% 
  fct_drop() %>% 
  levels()
```
:::note
There are many functions in R which might give you errors if you try to use factors which have "empty" levels. Generally, it is good practice to keep all levels of a factor (even if they are empty) until you encounter a function which requires you to explicitly remove the empty levels. There are also times when you might want to temporarily remove empty levels when generating plots and graphs.
:::

## `fct_recode`

This function lets you change the levels of a factor by hand. For example, if you wanted to expand the levels of our *month_dat* factor to show the full name of each month, then you could manually fix each level. The first argument, *.f*, is the factor you want to alter. Next you write the new name you want for a factor level followed by "=" and the old factor level which you want to replace.

```{r}
month_dat_full_names <- fct_recode(.f = month_dat,
                                   January = "Jan",
                                   Februrary = "Feb",
                                   March = "Mar",
                                   April = "Apr",
                                   May = "May",
                                   June = "Jun",
                                   July = "Jul",
                                   August = "Aug",
                                   September = "Sep",
                                   October = "Oct",
                                   November = "Nov",
                                   December = "Dec")

# Print to the console
month_dat_full_names
```
:::fyi
You can also remove a level from a factor using `fct_recode()` and setting the new name to `NULL`. Notice that any data from the removed level will now be missing as "January" is no longer a valid level.
```{r}
# remove the month of January
fct_recode(month_dat_full_names, NULL = "January")
```
