## Load Libraries {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(broom)     # tidy() and glance()
library(psych)     # describeBy()
library(here)      # here() for relative file paths
library(QuantPsyc) # standardized coefficients
library(tidyverse)
```

::: {.fyi}
If you have trouble installing the tidyverse package, you can install/load the individual packages that we need.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)   # mutate()
library(ggplot2) # plotting
library(readr)   # importing csv
```

## Create/Import Data

As usual, the next step is to either load some data into R or create some data ourselves. For the exercises within this lab, we will load some data from the file "gradgpa.csv"^[Adapted from pages 258-268 of Polit, D. F. (1996). Data analysis and statistics for nursing research. Stamford, CT: Appleton & Lange] (which should be inside the "data" folder within your R project).

```{r import_data}
# import data
data_corr <- read_csv(file = here("data",
                            "gradgpa.csv"))
```

## Clean Up the Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

For data imported using the {readr} package, you can check whether there were any parsing problems using the `problems()` function.

```{r check_for_problems}
# check for parsing problems
# e.g., were there problems forcing a variable to be a certain type
problems(data_corr)
```

It is always a good idea to `View()` your data **every** time you import it to ensure that the data look the way expect. This is especially important if you have never seen the data before.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# take a peak at the data
View(data_corr)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# HTML friendly data display
rmarkdown::paged_table(data_corr)
```

Everything looks to be in order with regard to the types of variables in this data set.

## Fit a Simple Regression Model

To fit a regression model in *R* (either simple or multiple) we can use the `lm()` function from base *R*.

There are at least two function arguments needed to fit a regression model: *formula*, and *data*.

We have used formulas a bit in our exercises so far, but here is a bit of a recap.

  * Formulas have a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS) separated by a tilde (~).
  * The LHS is for the dependent variable (DV)
  * The RHS is for the independent variables  (IV) and their interactions (there will be more on interactions next week).
  
A simple regression model has one continuous DV and one IV (typically also continuous).

Let's try to regress `GradGPA` onto `UndergradGPA`.

```{r}
# simple regression model
simple_lm_model <- lm(formula = GradGPA ~ UndergradGPA,
                      data = data_corr)
```

We can check the results from our simple regression model using the `summary()` function on our results object (`simple_lm_model`).

```{r}
summary(simple_lm_model)
```

If you want to get the results from our regression model into a tibble, you can use the `tidy()` and `glance()` functions from the {broom} package.

The `tidy()` function extracts the estimates for the intercepts and regression coefficients, their test statistics, standard error, and p values. You can also set `conf.int = TRUE` to get confidence intervals around the intercept and regression coefficients. This will add two new columns (`conf.low` and `conf.high`) which are the lower and upper boundaries of the confidence interval. `conf.level = .95` tells the `tidy()` function to compute a 95% confidence interval.

```{r eval=FALSE}
tidy(simple_lm_model,
     conf.int = TRUE,
     conf.level = .95)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
tidy(simple_lm_model,
     conf.int = TRUE,
     conf.level = .95) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

The `glance()` function extracts out the model level statistics like the $r^2$, adjusted $r^2$, test statistic, p value, and degrees of freedom.

```{r eval = FALSE}
glance(simple_lm_model)
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
glance(simple_lm_model) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

<!-- The model equation can be retrieved using the *equatiomatic* package (note that the coefficients are reported to 2 decimal places and not 3 like the lecture slides). -->

<!-- ```{r warning = FALSE,results= "asis"} -->
<!-- library(equatiomatic) -->
<!-- extract_eq(model = simple_lm_model, -->
<!--            intercept = "beta", -->
<!--            ital_vars = TRUE, -->
<!--            use_coefs = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

The {QuantPsyc} package has a handy function which can standardize model coefficients, `lm.beta()`.

```{r}
# get standardized coefficients
lm.beta(simple_lm_model)
```

As noted in the lecture slides, the standardized coefficient for a simple regression is identical to the correlation between the DV and the IV.

```{r}
cor(data_corr$UndergradGPA,
    data_corr$GradGPA)
```
